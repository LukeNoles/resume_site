                <h1>Career Objective</h1>
                <p>&emsp;Creative computer science graduate with a personal focus on front-end development. Blending social skills with technical know-how, I hope to bridge all gaps between the two. Offering experience as an artist, developer, team-player, communicator, and leader.</p>

            <div class="experience">
                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>&emsp;I took my first part-time job when I was 17. I worked doing detail/inventory for Teague-Noles 45 Auto Mart. I worked there for 5 years. I took a summer off to work as a counselor at Gander Book Youth Camp. At Gander Brook, I worked with my fellow counselors, taught classes, became a certified lifeguard, became certified in first-aid, and cared for both my camp and it's campers. The next summer, I had an internship with Bramblett Group Marketing. There, I worked on several network cabling jobs for local businesses and also learned more about front-end development.</p>

                <h2>Creative Background</h2>
                <p>&emsp;I've always been a creative at heart. In addition to a BA of Science, I also have a BA of Art. I studied theatre as a passion throughout college at FHU. There, I learned both performance and design. I was part of a team of faculty and students that wrote and performed "The Feed", a story about the social effects of media. "The Feed" was taken to the Edinborough Fring Festival to be performed. I also served as the Theatre Guild Secretary for a year and served as the President the following year.</p>
